              <h3><br>Verse 1:</br> </h3>
I can't remember when you weren't there<br>
When I didn't care for anyone but you<br>
I swear, we've been through everything there is<br>
Can't imagine anything we've missed<br>
Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do

            <h3><br>Chorus 1: </br></h3>
            Through the years, you've never let me down<br>
            You've turned my life around<br>
            The sweetest days I've found, I've found with you<br>
            Through the year, I've never been afraid<br>
            I've loved the life we've made<br>
            And I'm so glad I've stayed right here with you<br>
            Through the years
            <h3><br>Verse 2: </br></h3> I can't remember what I used to do<br>
            Who I trusted, whom I listened to before<br>
            I swear, you've taught me everything I know<br>
            Can't imagine needing someone so<br>
            But through the years it seems to me<br>
            I need you more and more
            <h3><br>Chorus 2: </br></h3>Through the years, through all the good and bad<br>
            I knew how much we had<br>
            I've always been so glad to be with you<br>
            Through the years, it's better every day<br>
            You've kissed my tears away<br>
            As long as it's okay, I'll stay with you<br>
            Through the years
            
            <h3><br>Chorus 3: </br></h3>Through the years, when everything went wrong<br>
            Together we were strong<br>
            I know that I belonged right here with you<br>
            Through the years, I never had a doubt<br>
            We'd always work things out<br>
            I've learned what love's about, by loving you<br>
            Through the years
            
            <h3><br>Chorus 4:</br></h3>Through the years, you've never let me down<br>
            You've turned my life around<br>
            The sweetest days I've found, I've found with you<br>
            Through the years, it's better every day<br>
            You've kissed my tears away<br>
            As long as it's okay, I'll stay with you<br>
            Through the years
